        When I was maybe 7 years old, I broke my right hand in school after falling down on ground with a heavy school bag. I came back home crying & kept my hand in same position to avoid extra pain from movement. Granny at home looked at me & said to someone that I don't know but an hour ago i felt something wrong happened & now this is what we're seeing!
      </p>
      
      <p class="mb-6 text-base sm:text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
        Nothing much. My hand wasn't broken hard enough, As my I'm disabled my hands have conditions under that they didn't put plaster but used crepe bandage.
      </p>
      
      <p class="mb-6 text-base sm:text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
        The only thing that I was excited about that whole week was of the birthday of my best friend who happens to live in front of my home! He had other best friends though. I talked to my granny if that I have to be okay before going to his birthday party. They laughed & said you need to take care.
      </p>
      
      <h3 class="text-xl font-light mb-4 mt-8">The Birthday Party</h3>
      
      <p class="mb-6 text-base sm:text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
        Well, I went to the party with the bandage on, it was still paining while moving my hand. Other guests were lost in themselves, none of them used to like me because I wasn't as cool as them. They atleast didn't bully me so I was kind of okay with being around them.
      </p>
      
      <p class="mb-6 text-base sm:text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
        Remember that time when we used to fill a big balloon with chocolates in it & hang it above/around the cake & the birthday boy! School shoes were apparently only shoes that we wore in parties & functions. I was there, they blew that big balloon & shower of chocolates & glitter happened. Everybody started the loot. I stood there because of my broken hand, smiled because everybody was having fun. A chocolate fell right in front of my eyes & as I tried bending down to pick it up, someone came & took it. I didn't get any chocolate in that party, but had food & came back home!
      </p>
      
      <p class="mb-6 text-base sm:text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
        I told granny that this happened & we were walking around a park, we went to the shop & bought myself an eclairs (üç¨) Honestly I didn't think I'd get it, or I deserved it or even if we have enough money for this thing to happen.
      </p>
      
      <p class="mb-10 text-base sm:text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
        But it happened. And it was maybe the first time I felt love, kindness & acceptance.
        I still remember everything in photographic image, I have tears just by remembering. I don't know why I wrote it, I don't know if I'll post it, all I know is I'm crying right now & it feels so good like it happened yesterday.

        It wasn't until I embraced vulnerability in my work that I began to see a profound shift in how people responded. There's something magnetic about raw, honest expression that cuts through the noise of our digital landscape. Whether through the unguarded gaze of a portrait subject or the candid admission in a personal essay, authenticity creates an immediate bridge between creator and audience.

      <p class="mb-6 text-base sm:text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
        Every photograph tells a story, but behind each image lies another narrative‚Äîthe creative process that brought it into being. Today, I want to pull back the curtain and share a glimpse into my workflow, from initial concept to final execution.
      </p>
      
      <p class="mb-6 text-base sm:text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
        My recent portrait series began not with a camera, but with a conversation. Over coffee with a friend who works in fashion, we discussed the intersection of personal style and identity‚Äîhow the clothes we choose both express and shape our sense of self. This dialogue sparked a vision: a collection of portraits that would explore this relationship, capturing subjects in environments that reflect their aesthetic choices.
      </p>
      
      <h3 class="text-xl font-light mb-4 mt-8">Finding Inspiration in the Everyday</h3>
      
      <p class="mb-6 text-base sm:text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
        Inspiration often arrives in unexpected moments. For this series, I found myself paying closer attention to strangers on the street, noting how their style choices seemed to telegraph aspects of their personality. I began collecting visual references‚Äînot just from fashion magazines, but from architecture, nature, and even food. The color palette for the series emerged from a particularly striking sunset I witnessed while stuck in traffic.
      </p>
      
      <p class="mb-6 text-base sm:text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
        In the studio, preparation is everything. Before each shoot, I create a mood board that combines visual references with written notes about the feeling I'm trying to evoke. I share this with my subjects ahead of time, inviting them into the creative process. Some of my favorite images from the series came from suggestions made by the subjects themselves.
      </p>
      
      <p class="mb-10 text-base sm:text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
        The editing process is where the final narrative takes shape. I typically spend three times longer editing than shooting, carefully selecting images that work both individually and as part of the larger story. For this series, I found myself drawn to moments of transition‚Äîthe split second where a posed expression gives way to something more authentic.
